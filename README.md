### Hackathon proposal

# We're excited to announce our upcoming Hackathon!

Participating teams will be tasked with implementing a sorting algorithm using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To guide their efforts, each team will receive an example project to serve as a foundation for their solution. Teams will be able to work in half hour sprints over the course of a week before presenting their project. Judging will be based on code quality, implementation and presentation. Some example projects include Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort...
